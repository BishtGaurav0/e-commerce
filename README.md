# 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

Live Demo: [https://bishtgaurav0.github.io/e-commerce/#/](https://bishtgaurav0.github.io/e-commerce/#/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 🔹 `npm start`
- Runs the app in development mode.  
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
- The page will reload when you make changes.  
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### 🔹 `npm test`
- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
- See more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

### 🔹 `npm run build`
- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

➡️ See the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### ⚠️ `npm run eject`
**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

- If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
- This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
- Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
- All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will now point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

> You don’t have to use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle-sized deployments.
